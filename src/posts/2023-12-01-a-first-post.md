## An Introduction

The seed of the idea that would become **theunderground.blog** was planted in my brain a long time ago. I can't remember when, but I vaguely remember writing a throw-away social media post about having an blog that was only available as RSS, then moving on. I was reminded of the idea while writing [a blog post about blogging][1], a couple of days ago, and wrote it down again. [Robb][2] let me know [over on Mastodon][3] that he thought it was a fun idea, and, well, here we are…

Honestly, I don't know how this is going to go, or how sustainable it will be. While a lot of blog content is consumed in a feed reader, all of the ecosystem expects certain things. Chief among those is _a website_ that constitutes the actual blog, with archive pages, extra information about the author, etc. Posts have URLs. You can share a post in an app or in a blog post of your own. You can comment on a post, link to it, search for it. This blog will have none of that. The only HTML page is the home page, and I only have that to provide for feed discovery. Everything else is at the mercy of whatever RSS-enabled client you are using to read this in right now.

But it's a fun experiment none-the-less, and I'm hoping to see it through to whatever end.

True to form, I haven't planned for anything beyond the "can it be done" aspects of this. I still haven't figured out exactly _what_ I'm going to write about. I have a few ideas, but nothing firm. We'll just have to see how it goes. Things might be a little random for a while as I explore RSS[^1] as a medium and it's limitations. Reading that back sounds quite pretentious, but I'm sticking with it.

## Interesting Links and Goings On

I figured I'd close out with a few of the interesting things that have passed through my feed reader lately, by way of giving this first post at least a little "value":

### App Defaults of 2023

The hottest blog post trend of the last week. [Over 200 people][defaults] have written a blog post about the default apps they've been using throughout 2023. Subscribe or import [the OPML file][defaultsopml] to add everyone to your feed reader.

### RSS Club

More bloggers! [RSS Club][rssclub] is a group organised by [Dave Rupert][dave], who commit to posting some _RSS-only_ content. I'll be adding **theunderground.blog** to the list once I'm sure it's going to last, as well, RSS-only content is all it will provide!

### Threads Dev Interviews

Ryan Swanstrom has been conducting interviews with a wide variety of people in the field of technology, in public, on Threads. You can also [read all of the archives][threads] on his blog.

### Why We're Dropping Basecamp

[First it was Duke University Libraries][duke], then it was [Gregg][gregg] dropping Basecamp because of the, shall we say, "outspokenness" of it's co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson. If people do or do not want to use their products, that's their choice and none of my business, but I will say: even though DHH and 37Signals were pretty influential on my early career, a few years ago they started to give me the ick; I dropped their products and stopped following the founders on social media and don't feel like I've missed anything of real value.

### Show Me Yours (Your Blogroll, That Is…)

Blogrolls are great, so [Frank invites us to share them][invite]. Here's [Frank's blogroll][fbr]. Here's [Tracy's blogroll][tbr] along with [a post about building community through blogrolls][community]. Here's [my blogroll][cbr], along with all the other RSS subscriptions I have. What about yours?

## Signing Off

So that was the first post/issue/entry in **theunderground.blog**. Hopefully there are a lot, lot more to come! As a reminder, there are no comments or webmentions available for these posts.
