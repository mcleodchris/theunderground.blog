## Hello!

If you're reading this then _thank you_! I honestly wasn't sure what the reception would be like, but the idea seemed to [go down reasonably well on Mastodon][1], so I got some positive reinforcement out of it - which is always nice. As I mentioned in [the explanatory post][2] over on my regular blog, I really enjoyed the "sort-of email newsletter" format of the first post, so that's the format we're going to continue with for now.

So what's been happening since the last time I wrote here? Well, it's been a rollercoaster few days. I'm still on a bit of a buzz about blogs; at the weekend I added some more "IndieWeb Building Blocks" to my blog, and I'm in the process of building out some more. I also came down with a stinker of a head cold, and we put up the [Christmas Tree][3]. My work project continues to beâ€¦ challenging, for non-technical reasons outside of my control. Last, but no means least, the blogs category in my reader continues to be filled with so many enjoyable posts. My time on social media has severely diminished over the last week or so as a result.

Hopefully you're all doing well!

## Interesting Links and Goings On

### IndieKit

[IndieKit][ik], by [Paul Robert Lloyd][prl] is a hostable Node.js server that can provide IndieWeb functionality to static sites running on Jekyll/Hugo/Eleventy, and other SSGs. It's customisable and adds [IndieAuth][ia], [Micropub][mp], and [syndication][syn] to your site. I set it up over the weekend and it's a foundation for some of the additions I'll be making over the coming months. It's not _too_ hard to setup (but still a bit technical), and when I get time I'll be writing up how I host it in Azure.

### The Internet Isn't Meant To Be So Small

[A nice long-form article][small] by Kelsey McKinney, [by way of Tim Bornholdt][tb]. This part about discoverability especially rung true to me:

> The reason the death of Google Reader matters, here, is that it marks a pivotal moment in the deliberate and engineered shrinking of the internet. When Google Reader died, article discovery shifted. People were no longer reading RSS feeds, finding new sites, following them, and being updated when those sites posted. Instead, they were scrolling on the endless feed of Twitter, and (at the time) Facebook, and they got whatever they got.

### On the Subject of Discoverability

I read [Encouraging Small Website Discoverability][swd], which led me to [The Small Website Discoverability Crisis][crisis], then on to [The Art of Hyperlinking][ah], and finally, [Build Personal Websites][bpw]. Lots of good stuff to chew on and mull over here. As a side-effect, I've learned a bit about [the Gemini protocol][II]. I can't see me using it (I'm too fond of HTTP) but it's interesting to know it's there and being experimented with.

### Down the Arcades

Colin shares this wonderful anecdote about his [childhood summers at the arcades][arcade]. I'm sharing for no more reason than I really enjoyed reading it!

### A Cure for Link-Rot?

A few months back, Remy [posted a solution to broken links][404] in blog archives caused by web pages being deleted or moved. Now they're back with a new service called [Unrot.link][unrot] anyone can use to achieve the same thing on their own blog. See [the announcement post][upa] for more details.

### How to Buy A Social Network

I've been meaning to link to [this interview][int] with [Matt Mullenweg][matt] for _ages_. It's a really good read (also available as a podcast), _especially_ through the lens of [what came next for Tumbler][tds].

## Signing Off
